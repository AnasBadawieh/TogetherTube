Project Idea: Synchronized Video Streaming Platform

Objective:
Develop a website that provides a synchronized video streaming experience for multiple users. The website should allow users to log in using a secure TOKEN authentication method and share a common video player that stays synchronized in real-time.

Key Features:

Login Authentication:

On opening the website, users are greeted with a login page.
Users must enter a valid TOKEN to proceed (managed securely using an .env file).
Main Page Functionality:

Once authenticated, the website displays:
A YouTube Player API.
A textbox labeled "Insert The URL Here" for users to input an embedded YouTube video URL.
The YouTube player loads the input video and plays it for all users in sync.
Synchronization:

The video player ensures real-time synchronization:
If User A inputs a YouTube URL and starts watching, other users who log in will join the same video at the same progress point.
Video progress, play/pause states, and other playback controls should sync for all active users.
Technologies to Use:

Frontend:
Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple and user-friendly interface.

Backend:
Node.js for handling:

Authentication.
Synchronization logic.
Real-time communication.
Database:
MongoDB to store:

User information.
Current video data and playback state.
Real-Time Communication:
Use WebSocket (e.g., Socket.IO) for real-time updates and synchronization of video states among users.

Environment Variables:
Use an .env file to securely manage:

Authentication TOKENs.
MongoDB URI.
Example Use Case:

Scenario:
User A logs in and inserts a YouTube URL to watch a video.
The video starts playing on the YouTube player for User A.
5 minutes later, User B logs in. User Bâ€™s YouTube player automatically joins the same video at the current playback progress.
Both users watch the video together in sync.
